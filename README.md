## Implementation:

- Issues / limitations:
    - Must run using `node index.js` (as instructed)
    - Because I use external texture (https://piazza.com/class/m8cunlsk2i24ew/post/197),
    src folder must include the following two files (external textures for court and basketball, it is inside this repository):
        - court_texture.jpg
        - texture.jpg
